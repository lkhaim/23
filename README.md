# 23
Using unittest framework and Selenium for testing an online store website.

The file 23andMe_online_purchase_smoke_test.py implements the solution.

The test performs the following 4 tasks:<br>
1. Add 3 health+ancestry and 2 ancestry only kits to the cart and verify that the kit count was correctly updated;<br>
2. Give unique names to the kits and verify that they has been successfully recorded;<br>
3. Add shipping info and check that VT -> CA correction has been done during verification;<br>
4. Continue to the payment page and verify that it was reached.

The test can be run in verbose mode from the command line as:<br>
<i>python 23andMe_online_purchase_smoke_test.py â€“v</i>

Note 1: path_to_chromedriver variable needs to be changed for your location of the driver<br>
Note 2: make sure that selenium and unittest modules are available in your python installation

<b>Limitations</b>

The verifications are minimal and are meant to serve as an example of their implementation rather than of appropriately testing the online store. Their extent and single-file and single-class implementation would be somewhat appropriate for a really quick smoke test. In production environment the input of test data should be done from a YAML or JSON file.
